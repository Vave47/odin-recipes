<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Get ready for the best rigatoni recipe. This rigatoni al segreto recipe was the</p> 
<p>most closely guarded secret at Gino's, one of New York City's most famous</p> 
<p>Italian restaurants. When it closed, the recipe got out, but I think the amount of</p> 
<p>butter was way too low, so here's my version.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed (or more to taste)</li>
    <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano (Italian) tomatoes, blended smooth</li>
    <li>½ cup water (to rinse out can of tomatoes)</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package uncooked rigatoni pasta</li>
    <li>½ cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and salt. <br> 
        Cook until no longer white and starting to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. <br>
        Stir in garlic; cook about 1 minute. Add red pepper flakes, then blended tomatoes <br> 
        with water. Bring to a simmer; adjust heat to medium or medium-low. <br> 
        Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 45 to 60 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
    
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling <br>
        water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, <br> 
        about 8 minutes (5 minutes from doneness).</li>

    <li>Add about 2/3 of the basil to the sauce. Stir in butter. When butter melts, <br> 
        add cheese in 3 increments.</li>
    <li>Drain pasta; transfer to sauce. Stir until rigatoni are evenly coated with sauce. <br> 
        Serve sprinkled with the remaining basil and a dusting of grated cheese.</li>
</ol>
